Potential improvements
If this app were to run in a production environment, I would set up a database to save data retrieved from the API.
I would then set a cron job to fetch the data every hour or so. 
This way, speed of web app would improve since it wouldnâ€™t have to make calls to the API every time there is a request. 
Also, this would prevent the web app from breaking whenever the API is down since it would have the local data to work with.
